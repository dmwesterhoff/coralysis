--------  README FILE FOR EDWARDS LAB IMAGE ANALYSIS PROJECT   ---------

 
========================================================================

DESCRIPTION:

    This is a port from Tyler Turner's python script which analyzes 
    image sets using OpenCV to analyze images for object recognition and 
    detection and hopefully will lead to correct image classification. 
    The reason for the port is to minimize the performance bottleneck in
    the image analysis area. C++ and CUDA support offers potential large 
    performance gains especially on very large image sets the gain 
    may be significant.

========================================================================

RUNNING THE PROGRAM: 
    
    The most important command line argument is the input directory of
    the image set to be parsed, and can be placed in any position of the
    arguments. All command line options are preceded by two hyphens
    followed by the character code. By default output is written to the
    current working directory with the filename "output.txt",
    if the filename for output already exists it will be overwritten.
    
    getting the help screen: "./coralysis --help"
    
    typical invocation: "./coralysis ../imgSet"
    
    recurse through directory: "./coralysis --r ../imgSet"
    
    write to file foo.txt: "./coralysis ../imgSet --w foo.txt"
